# MaubotGeoPlugin


## Introduction


#### üìù Description

The maubot implementation provides users the possibility of interacting with an automated bot on a communication platform. This enables the user to leverage services in the background, without having to understand the ‚Äúinner working‚Äù. One example would be the provision of information contained in the scorpio broker on demand or the proactive information sharing of the bot for certain time sensitive information. The bot shows an example implementation of a bot that interacts with the SALTED infrastructure, by querying organizations near the location posted by a user.

The SALTED project implemented a bot, based on the open source maubot framework (see: https://docs.mau.fi/maubot/index.html), that can be integrated in any platform that uses the Matrix framework as communication protocol. The communication platform supported by Matrix, which was used here, is the Element platform, since it offers the flexible scaling of the setup by implementing bridges to more common messenger services like Telegram and WhatsApp.


#### üèÜ Value Proposition

One challenge in disseminating innovations in the field of IoT is motivating potential users who are unfamiliar with the subject and have little or usually no prior knowledge in this area. Bots are widely used on websites of service providers or online-reatil-companies and are therefore already known by most people. Therefor they can be used as a tool to give access to more complicated services by wrapping them into a familiar frontend.


#### üéØ End User Frontend

The frontend and its basic functionality is provided by the communication platform itself:

* User says hello to the bot and asks for help:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SALTED-Project/MaubotGeoPlugin/master/images/HelloBot.jpeg" alt="hello bot" height="300px"/>



* User posts a location in a room

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SALTED-Project/MaubotGeoPlugin/master/images/LocationBot.jpeg" alt="hello bot" height="300px"/>

## Requirements (e.g. Matrix, Broker ...)


**Setup your matrix installation / choose an open one**

* see: https://matrix.org/try-matrix/

**Setup your maubot installation**

* use the official documentation: https://docs.mau.fi/maubot/usage/setup/index.html   


**You need make sure, that all further requirements for the bot are met, like a running scorpio broker and the publish services endpoint neded.**

1. Setup Scorpio broker
2. Setup Publish service
3. Test the needed endpoint: ``http://your-publish-ip:8003/broker/entities``
4. You can adapt the ``PluginCode/GeoBot/base-config.yaml`` and rebuild the plugin (see next steps) or use the pre-build plugin (``../GeoBot/salted.kybeidos.geobot-v1.0.1.mbp``) and adapt the config on the maubot GUI later on.



## Adding a Plugin on maubot interface


**Plugins can be added as .mbp per drag and drop on the maubot interface** 

* e.g. at http://localhost:29316/_matrix/maubot/#/new/plugin
* see: https://docs.mau.fi/maubot/usage/basic.html
* make sure to edit the config on the maubot GUI, to adapt the publish service ip


**Plugins can be added through dropping them as .mbp in the directory /data/plugins on the maubot host (before startup of maubot)**

* see: https://docs.mau.fi/maubot/usage/basic.html
* make sure to edit the config on the maubot GUI, to adapt the publish service ip

**Plugins can be individually build from code into .mbp and then added as described before.**

* Instructios on how to build a plugin can be found at: https://docs.mau.fi/maubot/usage/cli/build.html (for the build the mbc tool is needed, which is automatically availbale where you installed maubot, locally or within the docker container)
* Adapt the ``PluginCode/GeoBot/base-config.yaml```
* e.g. ``cd ./GeoBot && mbc build -o ./salted.kybeidos.geobot-v1.0.1.mbp ./``
